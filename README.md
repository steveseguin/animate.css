This is a fork of the original animate.css project; it was forked from the point where it was last updated as an MIT-licenced project, after which the licence changed to become non-compatible with open-source projects. Given the original project has also not been maintained in over a year, Jul 2022 to Nov 2023, I'll be pushing security updates and patches to this repository going forward instead, unless the original project owner choose to continue it.

## _Just-add-water CSS animation_

## Installation

Install with npm:

```shell
npm install animate.css --save
```

Install with yarn:

```shell
yarn add animate.css
```

## Getting started

You can find the Animate.css documentation on the [website](https://animate.style/).

## Accessibility

Animate.css supports the [`prefers-reduced-motion` media query](https://webkit.org/blog/7551/responsive-design-for-motion/) so that users with motion sensitivity can opt out of animations. On supported platforms (currently all the majors browsers and OS), users can select "reduce motion" on their operating system preferences and it will turn off CSS transitions for them without any further work required.
